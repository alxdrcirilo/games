# Video game reviews ðŸŽ®

This is a collection of reviews for various video games I've played. Each review includes details such as the game's name, release year, genres, rating, playtime, and my personal review.

The data itself for each game is fetched from IGDB (Internet Game Database) using their API. Then I process and display it in a user-friendly format. All the reviews are stored in a JSON file and can be easily accessed and modified.

The frontend is built using [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/).
