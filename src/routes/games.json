I much prefer having just one character to play with. The gameplay is a bit haphazard and uninteresting, the UI is also pretty bad. Not one I would recomment out of the remaining franchise in video gaming.","Platform":"PlayStation 2","Bought":"","Played":"Yes","Store":"Physical","Platforms":"PlayStation","URL":"https://www.igdb.com/games/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban--2"},{"Name":"God of War","Year":2005,"Genres":"Adventure,Hack and slash/Beat'em up,Puzzle","Rating":8.4,"Playtime":13,"Stars":"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","Review":"Gore to the core.
